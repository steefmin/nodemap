# nodemap
Generates a map hyperboria-nodes from internal router info

# requirements
Jquery: https://jquery.com/
Vivagraph: https://github.com/anvaka/VivaGraphJS

# initialize
For the first run, create a env.php and set the variables. (see env.php.example)
After that initialize the results-links.json as a proper json file with the first nodes. (first nodes entry should be your own node). I will create a script for this someday.
